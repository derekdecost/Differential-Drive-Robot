        Lab 4 Outline

        Positional Tracker ==> PID Controllers ==> Wheel Driver

        (1) Positional Tracker:
            Looks for april tags in the robots camera (speicifically tag 96 in this lab) and calculates 
            the error between the robot's position with respect to the tag and the goal position of 
            10cm from the tag and facing the tag.

            The error value(s) is sent to the PID controller to calculate the control value.

        (2) PID Controllers:
            Uses the error value provided by the position tracker to calculate the acceleration of the 
            robot. The PID controller sends this acceleration to the Wheel Driver node to control the 
            robot's motion.

        (3) Wheel Driver:
            Based on the PID controller acceleration, calculates the linear and angular velocity of the 
            robot and sends these values to the duckiebot wheel drivers.
